### Utilizing Pipeline Support in Laravel for Generating Large CSV Files

In `GenerateLocationConfigurationSheetAction.php`, I employed the [`Pipeline` facade in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/helpers#pipeline). This class orchestrates 8 distinct pipes (classes) to generate data for a CSV file that encompasses multiple columns, contingent upon the user's responses in a questionnaire.

Given the extensive number of columns derived from the questionnaire answers, processing all columns through a single class and its methods proved suboptimal. Consequently, I opted to decompose the task into smaller, more focused classes. Each class is tasked with a specific set of operations for a defined subset of columns, enhancing the readability, maintainability, and unit testability of the codebase.
